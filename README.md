# holoviz_panel_demonstrations
Holoviz Panel is a library for displaying data. Panel does not require html or actual web programming (it is possible to use those techniques with Panel, though) while building GUIs very similar to web pages. These example snippets are a side product of testing and debugging an application with a Holoviz Panel GUI.
