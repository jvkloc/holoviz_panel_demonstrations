Holoviz Panel is a library for displaying data interactively. Panel does not require html or actual web programming while it is suitable for building GUIs very similar to web pages. These example snippets are a side product of testing and debugging an application with a Holoviz Panel GUI I developed for Finland's Natural Resources Institute (Luonnonvarakeskus) in 2023-24.
